**Explanation**

Welcome, everyone! Today, we're going to take a brief tour of the Fairgen platform. To begin, you should have received an email containing your password, which you will need to log in. This introduction is part of the typical onboarding process for new Fairgen users.

When you first log in to Fairgen, you'll be greeted with a setup window. This is your opportunity to configure and personalize the platform according to your needs. One of the first steps you can take is to add colleagues or friends to your platform. For example, you can add a user named Sam and designate their role as either an admin or a member. The key difference between these roles is that admins have the authority to invite other people, while members have standard access rights.

If you choose not to add other users immediately, you can skip this step. Another initial setup feature involves data connectors, particularly if you're working with data stored on specific types of servers. If you're unfamiliar with connectors, feel free to skip this part. However, if you do need to use connectors, the process is straightforward: provide a name for the connector, input the bucket name, access key, secret key, and the region for integration. This setup is similar for HDFS connectors.

Lastly, you'll be prompted to name your first project. You might call it 'My First Project', for instance. After naming your project, you are all ready to dive into the Fairgen platform and start exploring its features.
