# Dataset

**Summary**
<br /> In this Loom, I provide an overview of dataset management on our platform. I explain how to upload datasets, create projects, and navigate between different tabs. I also demonstrate how to explore dataset details, change visualizations, and apply filters. Additionally, I discuss the training process and generating first sets. No specific action is requested from viewers, but this video serves as a helpful guide for using our platform effectively.
