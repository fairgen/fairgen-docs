**Summary**
<br /> In this video, I explain how to generate and analyze fairsets, which are augmented datasets. I walk you through the process of generating a fairset and show you how to compare it to the original dataset. We discuss the changes in proportions and how to interpret the results. I also demonstrate how to apply filters and modify them to further analyze the data. By the end of the video, you will have a clear understanding of how to use fairsets to improve your estimations.

**Explanation**

Once your fairset has been successfully generated, you will be directed to a specific page. To check the status of your dataset, navigate to the 'fairset' section. Here, the status should have changed from 'pending' to 'ready', indicating that the dataset is prepared and accessible.

Upon selecting the fairset in this section, you will be presented with an overview, similar to what is provided for the original dataset. To download your Fairet, simply click on the designated download link. For a deeper understanding of how your dataset was formed, you can refer to the 'Parameters' section, which details the conditions used for generation. Additionally, a sample view is available, showcasing the data and any columns that were omitted during generation - these are usually columns not relevant to our generation process.

Comparing the fairset with the original dataset is straightforward. You can initiate this comparison by clicking the 'Compare' button, which opens a new window for detailed analysis. This comparison generates a report, laying out the datasets side by side for an in-depth review. This comparative view is particularly useful for understanding the changes in data proportions post-augmentation. For instance, you might notice that in the fairset, the proportion of responses to a specific question differs from the original dataset, providing a new estimation based on the augmented data.

The report also delves into questions with a broad range of answers, illustrating how the responses have been adjusted in the fairset. It's important to remember that since a specific niche is generated in the fairset, the proportions might naturally differ from the original dataset.

The interface also features 'Filters', which, when applied, tailor the dataset comparison to specific conditions. These filters are crucial for accurate comparisons, especially when contrasting the niche segment of the original dataset with its augmented counterpart in Fairgen. You have the flexibility to modify existing filters or add new ones as needed. The filtered dataset, which usually defaults to the fairset, can also be downloaded for further analysis.

Fairgen's augmentation often brings to light subtle yet significant differences in data estimates. For example, you might observe changes in the percentage of respondents with different educational backgrounds. While some aspects remain similar between the original and fairsets, the differences highlighted are where Fairgen assists in refining your data analysis. However, keep in mind that due to the omission of certain columns in the fairset, the alignment with the original dataset might not always be exact.
