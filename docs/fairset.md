# Fairset

**Summary**
<br /> In this video, I walk you through the process of creating first sets on the platform. I show you how to check if your data set has been trained, how to generate first sets, and how to set the conditions for the niche you want to create. I also explain how to add and delete conditions, and how to check if your niche is within the boundaries set by Virgin. No action is requested from you, but this video will help you understand how to create first sets effectively.
