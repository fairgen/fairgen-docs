# Backtest

**Summary**
<br /> In this video, I walk you through the backtest tab, which is used to evaluate Vergeance technology. I explain that it's not necessary for everyday production but is helpful during due diligence. I demonstrate how to start a backtest, choose demographic columns, and generate the backtest. I also show you the niche segment plot and the global plot, which help analyze the results. Additionally, I explain how to look at specific answers and niches. No action is requested from you, but this video will provide valuable insights into using Vergeance technology effectively.
