# Dataset

**Summary**
<br /> In this video, I provide an overview of dataset management on our platform. I explain how to upload datasets, create projects, and navigate between different tabs. I also demonstrate how to explore dataset details, change visualizations, and apply filters. Additionally, I discuss the training process and generating your first dataset.

**Explanation**

One of the key features of Fairgen is its ability to handle various types of datasets. While there are limits on formats and sizes, most standard datasets should be compatible with the platform. For those who don't have a dataset ready but want to try out the platform, Fairgen offers sample datasets. You can easily load these into the platform with just a click.

The platform is organized into six different tabs. The 'Projects' tab is where you can create new projects and upload datasets. It's possible to upload multiple datasets into one project, provided they have a similar structure in terms of questions and columns. Next, there's the 'Datasets' tab, dedicated to uploading your datasets. The 'Fairset' tab is where you create new synthetic datasets using Fairgen’s technology.

For analytical comparisons, the 'Report' tab allows you to contrast datasets and fairsets, highlighting the differences and similarities between them. The 'Backtest' tab is particularly useful for testing your data against the ground truth to evaluate the effectiveness of Fairgen technology. Lastly, the 'Settings' tab offers customization options for various parameters. Navigating between these tabs is straightforward and can be done with simple clicks.

Focusing on the 'Datasets' tab, let's take the example of the 'Stack Overflow' dataset in my first project. This dataset provides a comprehensive overview, showcasing the distribution of answers to various questions. For example, you might observe that 18% of responses to a particular question are 'No', while 81% are 'Yes', with 0% non-answers. The platform allows for different visualizations and sorting options, enhancing the analysis of categorical, ranking, and continuous columns.

An interesting feature is the filters, which let you focus on specific types of columns – categorical, continuous, or ranking. These filters can be cleared, or you can search for specific columns like 'Profession'. Additional functionalities include downloading the dataset, viewing its creation date, and accessing other relevant information. There’s also an option to view the sample data and understand which columns were dropped during processing. Sometimes, the platform might drop columns with open-ended answers or other specific characteristics.

The training part is a crucial aspect of using Fairgen. Here, you can choose to exclude certain columns from the training process. Once the training is initiated, it typically takes between 5 to 20 minutes, depending on your dataset's size. After the training is complete, you can proceed to generate fairsets either directly from the training section or by navigating to the 'Fairset' tab.

This brief introduction should help you get started with the Fairgen platform, focusing on the overview tab and the basic steps for managing datasets and generating fairsets.
