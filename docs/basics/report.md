# Report

**Summary**
<br /> In this video, I explain how to generate and analyze fairsets, which are augmented datasets. I walk you through the process of generating a fairset and show you how to compare it to the original dataset. We discuss the changes in proportions and how to interpret the results. I also demonstrate how to apply filters and modify them to further analyze the data. By the end of the video, you will have a clear understanding of how to use fairsets to improve your estimations.
