# Fairset

**Summary**
<br /> In this video, I walk you through the process of creating fairsets on the platform. I show you how to check if your data set has been trained, how to generate fairsets, and how to set the conditions for the niche you want to create. I also explain how to add and delete conditions, and how to check if your niche is within the boundaries set by Fairgen.

**Explanation**

In this tutorial, we're going to explore the primary function of the Fairgen platform: creating fairsets. Assume you have already uploaded your dataset and trained it. To confirm the training status, you can click on the 'Training' section or check the training status indicator at the end of the interface. Once your dataset is trained, you can proceed to generate a fairset by either clicking the 'Generate' button directly or navigating to the 'Fairsets' section and selecting 'Generate.'

Upon initiating generation, a pop-up window appears where you can select your dataset. In this example, we have uploaded only one dataset to our project, so no change is needed here. Next, you'll focus on the generation type. In the settings you are working with, you should see only the 'Condition' generation type, meaning that you are always using condition-based generation.

Now, let's choose the specific condition or niche you want to create. For instance, if you're aiming to generate a fairset comprised of full-time students who are also independent contractors, you can set these conditions accordingly. You have the flexibility to add multiple conditions using the '+' button and remove them as needed. You might, for example, want to generate a fairset of all respondents who answered 'yes' and are either full-time or part-time students.

In the process, you can choose whether to include or exclude outliers. It's generally recommended to leave this setting as it is. After setting your conditions, verify if your niche falls within the boundaries provided by Fairgen. For instance, you might find that there are 216 full-time or part-time students who are independent contractors suitable for your niche.

It's important to remember that the interface does not refresh automatically. Therefore, make sure to manually refresh the page to confirm that your fairset has been successfully created.
