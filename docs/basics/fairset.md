# Fairset

**Summary**
<br /> In this video, I walk you through the process of creating fairsets on the platform. I show you how to check if your data set has been trained, how to generate fairsets, and how to set the conditions for the niche you want to create. I also explain how to add and delete conditions, and how to check if your niche is within the boundaries set by Fairgen.
